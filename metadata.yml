Title: AntibioticDB similarity matches matches
Description: Check whether compounds match with known antibiotics available from
  GARDPs AntibioticDB database. The tool simply performs Morgan fingerprint 
  (radius 2, 1024 bits) with the Tanimoto similarity. Multiple similarity 
  cutoffs are tested. The model also performs a simple (Naive Bayes) binary 
  classification based on Murcko and BRICS scaffolds.
Deployment:
  - Local
Source: Local
Source Type: Internal
Task: Annotation
Subtask: Activity prediction
Input:
  - Compound
Input Dimension: 1
Output:
  - Value
Output Dimension: 11
Output Consistency: Fixed
Interpretation: Number of compounds in AntiboticDB similar to the input compound
  above a given cutoff (num_sim) and probability of being an antibiotic compound
  based on scaffolds (scaff_class). Similarities are done against the full 
  database (all) as well as a subset of manually curated compounds (254).
